[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddnn_node.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "dnn_node",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dnn_node" with any
  of the following names:

    dnn_nodeConfig.cmake
    dnn_node-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dnn_node" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dnn_node_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dnn_node" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
